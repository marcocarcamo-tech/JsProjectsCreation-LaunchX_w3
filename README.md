# JsProjectsCreation-LaunchX_w3

This is the first project of week 3 from Mission NodeJs by LaunchX, and in this project we learnt the proper way to create and organize a Node/JS project from scratch. 
There are some considerations to create a functional application with node

1.Create yor package.json with npm init command or npm init -y for a quick start
2.ALWAYS use system version control and type the command git init as soon as you started a new project
3.Create the directories your project will need
4.Add dependencies you need with npm install, usually you'll install them as dev dependencies so you can use npm install --save-dev dependency_name
5. Create your files in the proper directory and modularize your code so you can export and import it
6. Finally and most important is to add unit tests and never trust in a test wich has never been broken, check your test works but also check cases in which your test breaks, so you could know it is really helpful
